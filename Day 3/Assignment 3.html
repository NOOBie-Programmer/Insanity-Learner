        <b>1.Explained: In criticism & lawsuit, debate over coding for kids<br><br>
        (i)Why is learning to code a big deal?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        At the turn of this century, when extremely affordable computers made their way into technical and engineering colleges across the country, India was able to produce a huge army of coders and programmer-essentially people who can create computer software.
        As computing devices have taken over every aspect of life, the need for good programmers and coders has been increasing relentlessy-and calls to teach coding and programming to young students have got louder. In recent years, platform and companies
        have started to claim that kids as young as those in elementary school must begin to learn coding.

    <p>
        <b>(ii)How did the call to start teaching code to children in elementary school come about?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since the advent of computers and the arrival of computer coding as the next big thing, leaders of technology companies around the world have pushed for coding to be included as a subject in the middle or higher secondary school for students who may be
        interested to learn. In 2018, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wrote in a blog post that everyone could benefit from learning the basics of computer science. According to Gates, coding, which he taught himself and fell in love with at the age of
        13, led him to ask questions about how to achieve tasks, and find answers to questions."The question it teaches you to ask-How do you accomplish a task? Can you find a pattern? What data do you need?-are useful no matter where you go in life,"
        Gates wrote.

        <b>(iii)What do the critics of code-learning at an early age say?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary contention against learning to code at a very young age is that some age groups, which are being targeted by platforms, are being pushed into it even before they have mastered the mathematicals and technologicals fundamentals. A metaphor that
        is often used is that children are being made to ride a bicycle before they have even learnt to walk. Software engineer Pradeep Poonia, 30, a vocal critic who has become a prominent voice in the debate, says, "There's a reason why in mathematics
        addition is taught first, then subtraction, then multiplication, and then division. It is necessary to learn several elements of mathematics and logical thinking before one can code.[What many of the online platforms are doing these days] is like
        someone teaching you to draw a car under the pretext of making you learn how to build a car."
